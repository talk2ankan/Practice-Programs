   * variable's scope. All variables within a block of code are automatic
   * by default, but this can be made explicit with the `auto` keyword.

  /*
   * The `register` Storage Class
   * ======================================================================
   * Using the storage class `register` is a hint to the compiler to cache
   * the variable in a processor register. Other than not allowing the
   * referencing operator (&) to be used on the variable or any of its
   * subcomponents, the compiler is free to ignore the hint. This also means
   * that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size
   * (usually one word).
   *
   * It should also be noted that defining `register` does not mean that
   * the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be
   * stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation
   * restrictions.

   * The `static` Storage Class
   * ======================================================================
   * Static is the default storage class for global variables. Static
   * variables can be 'seen' within all functions in this source file.
   * At link time, the static variables defined here will not be seen by
   * the object modules that are brought in.
   *
   * Static can also be defined within a function. If this is done the
   * variable is initialized at run time but is not reinitialized when the
   * function is called. This inside-a-function static variable retains its
   * value during various calls.

   * cannot be initialized as all it does is to point the variable name at
   * a storage location that has been previously defined.
